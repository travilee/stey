<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Hi, my name is Travis, a.k.a. 
&quot;Moon.&quot; I'm a native Topekan but I've always had a strong desire to live 
somewhere else. In May of this year (2003) I'll be graduating from Washburn with 
my bachelor's degree in Social Work and then in June I'm outta here! I'll be 
moving to Seattle, WA, to live near my brother.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Where did the name Moon come from? 
I'm something of a hippie deep down. I used to work at West Ridge 8 as an 
assistant manager and we had a couple of other Travi (as in more than one 
Travis) working at the theater. It got pretty confusing sometimes with everyone 
yelling &quot;Travis&quot; so I made a nametag with the name &quot;Moonbeam&quot; on it. That's how 
it started.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>I've been facilitating STEY since 
June 1999, shortly after I moved back to Topeka from living in Charlotte, NC. I 
had attended STEY before I moved to NC after starting to come out in 1997 and 
1998. The group had actually fallen apart during the time I lived away. Since 
then I have had the honor of watching the group grow from a few members 
attending every two weeks to the now weekly support/social group that sees 12 to 
20 members attending. In my time, I've also seen the support in our local high 
schools grow with gay/straight alliances springing up in Topeka High, Topeka 
West, and Washburn Rural. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>As I prepare to move to Seattle, I'm 
hoping that the legacy I'm leaving behind will continue to grow, rather than 
STEY collapsing like it did before. Thanks to all of you who have made my job 
such a fun one. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>As the time gets closer, I'll post 
some contact info for me in Seattle so you can all keep in touch with me. I'd 
love to be a tour guide if any of you ever make your way up to the great Emerald 
City!</b></font></p>
